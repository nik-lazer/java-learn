To overcome these problems, Java introduced NIO (New IO) in Java 4. The key features of NIO were:
•	 Channels and Selectors: NIO offered support for various types of channels. A channel is
an abstraction over lower-level file system features (such as memory-mapped files and file
locking) that lets you transfer data at a faster speed. Channels are non-blocking, so Java
provides another feature—a selector—to select a ready channel for data transfer. A socket is a
blocking feature whereas a channel is a non-blocking feature.
•	 Buffers: Java 4 introduced buffering for all primitive classes (except for Boolean). It provided
the Buffer class that offers operations such as clear, flip, mark, reset, and rewind. Concrete
classes (subclasses of the Buffer base class) offers getters and setters for setting and getting
data to and from a buffer.
•	 Charset: Java 4 also introduced charset (java.nio.charset), encoders, and decoders to map
bytes and Unicode symbols.
